### üèéÔ∏è Supersonic browser tabbing
![](https://github.com/kentywang/Flywheel/blob/master/demo.gif) 

When there's dozens of tabs open on a browser, the tab bar doesn't have room to show enough meaningful information about each tab, so navigation to a specific tab usually devolves into sequentially tabbing through the list until reaching the desired one.

This Chrome extension provides a quicker method of changing tabs. Hold down Alt/Option (‚å•) to bring up a radial menu with all open tabs and then move the mouse to navigate to a specifc tag. This means only one keypress is needed to reach any tab, and navigation can be nonsequential.

More development to come.
