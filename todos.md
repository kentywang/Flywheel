### Tasks:

- fix leftover hud [DONE]
- leftover mouselistener [DONE]
- errors [DONE]
- get pointerlock working [DONE]
- get better mousetracking [DONE]  
- switching to incorrect tabs on input [DONE]
  - reason: divvying up sections wrong.
- I think I solved the lefthover hud issue (not the most elegant solution, [DONE]
  - using state instaed of figuring out root)
- sticky hud, unsticks after keydown and keyup [DONE]
  - (my guess is keyup not being detected)
- page sometimes not detecting any key events until mouseclick [DONE]
  - think it's cuz focus is on console
- radial distance from first hold [DONE]


- placeholder favicon
- give icons nice border radius!

- normalize css
- better styling

- handle multiple windows

- namespace #hud

- merge state and pointer

- hud color/bold issues

- selectedtabindex wrong values??

- implement buffer zone for selected tab?

- snapping/slighty-sticky tabs?

- keyup not triggered sometimes, not even from fallthroughs

- separate functionality needed for updating hud vs adding new hud (for when changing selected tab)

- switching to new tabs makes hud sticky (maybe I could only add to page once start moving on new pg)
